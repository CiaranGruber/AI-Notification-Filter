# AI-Notification-Filter

This project acts as the backend to the complete AI-notification filter project.

## Usage

Prior to running the program, you'll need to create a .env file in the root of the project and add a GMI Cloud API key in order to run the program.

Once this is done, you can simply run `npm install` and `npm run dev` with node installed and you should have a localhost connection which you can use to access the AI interface.

## Project Structure

All backend code to be integrated with the full project is available under `src/ai_api`. Source code under `src/test_ui` is code related to running the test UI and provides an easy to use interface to test things out.
